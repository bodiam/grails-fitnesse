This all revolves around instances of GrailsTestType. Basically you need to implement that (subclass GrailsTestTypeSupport if you can) and then register it.

For an example of registration, see: http://code.google.com/p/spock/source/browse/trunk/spock-grails/scripts/_Events.groovy


The classes/interfaces in this area (e.g. GrailsTestType) are reasonably well javadoc'd, which serves as the documentation for this.
