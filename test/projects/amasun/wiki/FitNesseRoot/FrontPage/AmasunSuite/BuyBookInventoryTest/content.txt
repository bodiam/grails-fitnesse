!1 Functionality - Buying a book modifies inventory

One of the core businesses from Amasun is to sell books. To verify that the inventory part of this core functionality works, we've created an initial acceptance test which will support this business functionality.

!2 Exercise
The test driver for the verification step is missing. Implement it and make sure the test succeeds.
