!1 Functionality - Calculate shipping costs

The available shipping methods are displayed to the customer. We support "one-day shipping" and "two-day shipping", the user has to select
a shipping method. 

When the user chooses "one-day shipping", dependening on the category, different costs are charged. Namely, for every book in the category 
"fantasy" 2.00 EURO is charged,for every book in the category "thriller" 3.00 EURO is charged and for the "IT" category 10.00 EURO per book is 
charged. 

Different prices per category apply for the "two-day shipping" too, namely 1.50 EURO for the "fantasy" category, 1.90 EURO for the 
"thriller" category and 8.90 EURO for the "IT" category.

When the order contains any hardcover books, an additional 3.00 EURO of shipping costs are added to the total of shipping costs. So it doesn't matter 
how many hardcover books are added, the additional costs are always 3.00 EURO.

The user also has to provide a shipping location, we currently ship to three locations: The Netherlands, Europe and to the US. If the shipping location 
is in the Netherlands, then no additional costs are being charged. If it's in Europe than 2.00 EURO is added to the shipping total and if it's in the US, 
then 10.00 EURO is added to the shipping total.
